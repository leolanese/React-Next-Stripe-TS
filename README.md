# Stripe + TypeScript Next.js test example

## Stripe-Next-TS

This is a really simple project that shows the usage of Next.js with TypeScript.

## Note

> Note on the side, we will need these KEYS from Stripe (dashboad/keys) account

```js
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
```
